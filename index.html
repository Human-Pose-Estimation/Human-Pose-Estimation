<p>
The Kinect2 Human Pose Dataset (K2HPD) collected by us includes about 100K depth images with various human poses under challenging scenarios. These detph images are captured by the kinect2 with the reolution 512x424. K2HPD contains many different posees with different distances in many different scenes, including many challenging scenes and some unusual poses and occluded-poses. As illustrated in Fig. 2, this dataset consists of 19 body joints (see Fig. 3 for more details) of 30 subjects under ten different challenging scenes. The subject is asked to perform both normal daily poses and unusal poses. The human body joints are defined as follows: Head, Neck, UpperSpine, MiddleSpine, DownSpine, RightShoulder, RightElbow, RightWrist, RightHand, LeftShoulder,  LightElbow, LeftWrist, LeftHand, RightHip, RightKnee, RightFoot, LeftHip, LeftKnee, LeftFoot.

<h2>Training and Testing Partition</h2>
To make fair comparsion, we split the whole dataset to 5 subsets to perform 5-fold cross-validation.
<blockquote>
<p>
1.[<a href="groundtruthfiles/depthpart1.txt">Train and Test Partition 1</a>]<br>
2.[<a href="groundtruthfiles/depthpart2.txt">Train and Test Partition 2</a>]<br>
3.[<a href="groundtruthfiles/depthpart3.txt">Train and Test Partition 3</a>]<br>
4.[<a href="groundtruthfiles/depthpart4.txt">Train and Test Partition 4</a>]<br>  
5.[<a href="groundtruthfiles/depthpart5.txt">Train and Test Partition 5</a>]<br>  
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> To benefit the CNN based algorithm, we also provide the heat-map, which describes the likeli-hood of a joint occurring in each spatial location. Specially, it maps the location to a image that the value of this location is high.

<a id="dataset-details" class="anchor" href="#dataset-details" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dataset Details</h1>

<p>The dataset contains depth images captured by kinect2 with different people(boys and girls,about 30), different height,different distances and different challenging sceness(from simple scenes with only white wall to very challenging scenes which include many normal objects such as chairs). The dataset is aimed at detecting human poses, so many depthimages are human usual life poses.
Besides, We captured many unusual poses and images with self-occlusion for the puspose of getting better detecting accuracy and generalization. You can see the appendix to know the poses our dataset  </p>

<p>The K2HPD dataset contains many human activies in usual life and some unusual posees in very challenging scenes. We captured theses depth images using kinect2 because kinect2 has a better depth image sensor compared to other similar devices such as kinect1 or xtion, which will be beneficial to learning both in accuracy and robustness. We use people to examine these depth images and for those  accuracy, we leave it as the groundtruth. for those not accurate, we only change the position of non-accurate part and leave others as kinect2 detected them. We used our own fast and  convenient java tools to adjust these joint positions, which can be very accurate with the location showing in each image(the joint will be shown when you put your mouse over it ,so you don't worry about confusing them. The location will show on the console windows so you can adjust the position at pixel level).<br>

<p>Our dataset contains the following class:(far more than that, We only show some standard of them because many pose is combination of many poses or you can't say clearly what class the belong): </p>

<p>1.Calling phone<br>
2.Drinking water<br>
3.Playing Tai Chi<br>
4.Walking around<br>
5.Giving a strecth<br>
6.Picking up something<br>
7.Driving car<br>
8.Wiping the glass<br>
9.Playing Basketball<br>
